NODULE4, AND 3RIGHT PLEURA4,
                MULTIPLE PLEURAL BIOPSIES WITH PLEURECTOMY

FIBROSARCOMATOUS TYPE.
B.     HYALINE PLEURAL PLAQUE.

COMMENT:
The pleural biopsy shows a biphasic malignancy, with the epithelioid component
consisting of tubulopapillary growth of cuboidal cells.  The epithelioid
elements contain an in situ component within the pleura particularly noted in
the Part 4 specimen.  In addition, there is a spindle cell component, with
cytologically atypical spindle cells arranged in fascicles within a myxoid
matrix, admixed with these epithelioid elements.
Diastase predigested PAS stains fail to show evidence of intracytoplasmic
neutral mucin.  Immunostains demonstrate that the neoplastic cells express
Cytokeratin 5/6, nuclear Calretinin, nuclear WT1, and fail to express the
following antigens:  Leu-M1, B72.3, BER EP4, TTF, and Carcinoembryonic
Antigen.
Overall, the histomorphology and the immunophenotype strongly support a
diagnosis of diffuse malignant mesothelioma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in four parts.
Part 1 received fresh with the patient's name, initials JW, and labeled "right
pleura," consists of a 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.5cm section of a pink yellow rubbery
tissue, Representative portions of which are submitted following frozen
section evaluation labeled 1A.
Part 2 received fresh with the patient's name, initials JW, and labeled "right
pleural biopsy," consists of four irregular portions of pink yellow, soft
tissue, each 0.3 cm in greatest dimension and entirely submitted following
frozen section evaluation labeled 2A.
Part 3 received fresh with the patient's name, initials JW, and labeled "right
lung nodule," consists of a 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.4cm resection of pink yellow, soft
tissue.  Representative portions are submitted following frozen section
evaluation labeled 3A.
Part 4 received fresh with the patient's name, initials JW, and labeled "right
pleura," consists of a single irregular portion of pink yellow, soft tissue,
2.0 x 1.5 by 0.2 cm.  The specimen is entirely submitted labeled 4A.
