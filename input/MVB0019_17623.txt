A.          DIFFUSE MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, TUBULOPAPILLARY TYPE.

COMMENT:
This case has been discussed with **NAME[M. ZZZ], M.D.  As indicated in that
discussion, the pericardial biopsy shows a tubulopapillary proliferation of
cytologically bland cuboidal cells, which infiltrate  submesothelial
connective tissue and extend into the pericardial adipose tissue.  The cells
fail to express neutral mucin with PAS/PAS-D stains and immunostains show that
the neoplastic cells express WT1, nuclear calretinin, D240 and cytokeratin 5/6
and fail to express carcinoembryonic antigen, TTF-1, Leu-M1, BER-3P4 and
B72.3.  Overall this morphology is typical of a diffuse tubulopapillary
malignant mesothelioma, which in the context of calcified hyaline plaques may
be related to asbestos exposure.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received unfixed labeled with the patient's name, initials SA
and "parietal pericardium".  The specimen consists of multiple tan-pink,
irregular, rubbery fibromembranous portions of tissue with a scant amount of
adipose tissue attached.  The specimens measure 12.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm in
aggregate.  The entire specimen is submitted in cassettes labeled A through
ZZ.

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis. 
 
The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:
The testing was developed and its performance characteristics determined by
the **INSTITUTION of Pathology, as required by the CLIA
'88 regulations.  The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use.
