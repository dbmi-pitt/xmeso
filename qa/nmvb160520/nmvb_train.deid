CLINICAL HISTORY: Developed dyspnea on exertion 3 months ago while
working in China. Chest x-ray revealed large right pleural effusion with
total collapse of right lower lobe, cytology from thoracentesis suggestive
of CA. Bronchoscopy inconclusive. CT reveals no evidence of mediastinal
adenopathy or evidence of metastatic disease. 

NATURE AND SOURCE OF SPECIMEN: Pleura and chest wall MACROSCOPIC:The
specimen is received fresh in the frozen section room labeled pleura and
chest wall. It consists of three irregular fragments of tan-white, rubbery
tissue ranging from 0.5 x 1.5 cm. in greatest dimension and all 0.2 to 0.3
cm. in thickness. A piece of tissue is frozen. FROZEN SECTION 

DIAGNOSIS: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, FAVOR MESOTHELIOMA OVER ADENOCARCINOMA
(BB). A piece of tissue is sent for electromicroscopy and a piece of each
is snap frozen. The remainder of the frozen tissue is totally submitted
labeled 1FS and the non-frozen tissue is totally submitted labeled 1.
TO/JS/nlm 11/3/86 

MICROSCOPIC: (2 H&E, 1 PAS, 1 PAS-D, 1 Mucicarmine, 1 Alcian blue, 1
Alcian blue with hyaluronidase, IPEX-1 CEA, 1 Prekeratin) Sections reveal
fibrous pleura with foci of malignant tumor. The tumor consists of sheets
of polygonal cells with abundant acidophilic cytoplasm, and foci of tubule
formation. Some cells show vacuolization of cytoplasm. There is loss of
cohesion with dispersion of cells in the loose stroma. Immunoperoxidase
staining is positive with prekeratin and negative for CEA. There is some
cytoplasmic PAS positivity which is sensitive to diastase digestion.
Mucicarmine stain is negative. Alcian blue shows focal intracellular and
marked stromal positivity which decreases with hyaluronidase digestion.

MICROSCOPIC:
The pleural biopsies reveal a thickened fibrous tissue with dense
areas of sclerosis change.  This tissue is infiltrated by a
malignant neoplasm which is arranged in sheets and gland-like
formations.  It is associated with a surrounding desmoplastic
response.  Cytologically the cells show marked nuclear
pleomorphism, high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, hyperchromatic
marginated chromatin with dense chromatin clusters and prominent
nucleoli.  Rare areas of intraluminal mucus-type substance is
seen.  Histochemical stains reveal focal areas of mucin
positivity and rare intracytoplasmic PAS positive, diastase
resistant material.  Alcian blue positive material is seen in
occasional cells and weak positivity remains after treatment with
hyaluronodasis.  Immunoperoxidase stain for tumor associated
glycoprotein (B72.3) is weakly positive in many of the cells. 
Leu-M1 is positive in very rare tumor cells.  Staining for
epithelial membrane antigen is strongly and diffusely positive in
the tumor cells with a membranous accentuation.  Carcinoembryonic
antigen with monoclonal antibody are uniformly negative.

RESULTS:
GROSS EXAMINATION:
Two vials of tissue were received in Karnovsky's fixative labeled
"***PATH-NUMBER[2]" (no part specified) and "***PATH-NUMBER[2], part 3" and were
processed entirely for electron microscopy.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Toluidine Blue Sections:
Examination of Toluidine blue stained sections shows areas of
infiltrative tumor cells with intercellular spaces and lacking
gland formation which are similar to that identified on HE
sections.

Ultrastructural Examination:
Ultrastructurally, the malignant cells show numerous delicate,
long microvilli on all sides of the cells.  These microvilli do
not contain dense microfilament cores.  The length to width ratio
of the microvilli average 8-12:1.  The cells have desmosomes, but
lack junctional complexes.  The cytoplasm lacks mucin droplets
and contains homogeneous, moderately electron dense accumulations
of lipid or glycosaminoglycans.  The nuclei contain prominent
nucleoli and occasional nuclear pseudoinclusions.  These findings
are consistent with mesothelial differentiation and essentially
exclude the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.  Thank you for involving
us in the care of this patient.

ADDENDUM #1
As noted in the prior surgical pathology report this case has
been sent to the **INSTITUTION where several consultants, including
**NAME[UUU M. TTT], M.D. have reviewed this case.  These consultants
believe the left pleural biopsy shows a markedly atypical
mesothelial proliferation most consistent with a mesothelioma. 
In my discussions with them, they believe that if the patient is
going to be treated in an aggressive fashion, a more substantial
biopsy may be necessary to provide an unequivocal diagnosis of
diffuse malignant mesothelioma.

COMMENT:
This is a difficult case, and has been reviewed by several
members of our department including Dr. **NAME[VVV WWW] and Dr. **NAME[SSS
RRR].  The differential diagnosis is between an atypical floridly
reactive mesothelial proliferation vs an early (in-situ /
superficially invasive) mesothelioma.  Deeper levels have been
performed without a clear resolution.  This case is being sent to
Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT], the pathologist heading the mesothelioma study
group, in consultation.

My electronic signature on this report is attestation that I have personally
reviewed the submitted material and/or data included in this special
procedure report and that my interpretation reflects this evaluation.

RESULTS:
Tissue was received in Karnovsky's fixative labeled "***PATH-NUMBER[2],
Mediastinal Bx" for complete electron microscopy workup.  The
tissue was processed and semithin sections were cut, but further
studies were not required and were canceled.  Electron microscopy
processing was completed and blocks held for possible further
studies. 

RESULTS:
Tissue submitted on this patient was sent to our lab for electron
microscopy block processing.  The specimens were received in
Karnovsky's fixative, subsequently we post-fixed in osmium
tetroxide, en bloc stained with uranyl acetate, dehydrated the
tissue, infiltrated it with Epoxy resin and polymerized it in a
heated oven into blocks for sectioning.  The blocks were not
thick/thin sectioned or examined by TEM for ultrastructural
diagnostic analysis at the request of the submitting pathologist
and/or physicians.  The specimen was processed in this manner to
assure that appropriately processed tissue would be available if
needed at a future date.  Thank you for involving us in the care
of this patient.

Since there was no request for diagnostic electron microscopy on
this case by the time of signout, the case should now be
considered complete.  Thank you for involving us in the care of
this patient.

ADDENDUM #1
The mediastinal lymph nodes with metastatic mesothelioma from the
left pneumonectomy specimen (part 5) are located above the
bronchus and pulmonary artery and therefore to the best
estimation are located in the tracheal area.  This would
correspond to lymph node stations 2, 3 or 4.

_______________________________________________________________________________

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received unfixed in eight parts labeled with the
patient's name and demographics.
Part 1 received in surgery labeled "level 6".  Consists of a
single irregular, gray-black anthracotic lymph node, 0.5 cm. in
greatest dimension, with adherent soft, yellow, adipose tissue,
entirely submitted for frozen section.  The remaining tissue is
totally submitted labeled 1AFS.

Part 2 labeled "level 8".  Consists of a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm.
rubbery, grossly encapsulated, pink node with attached soft,
yellow fatty tissue.  The cut surfaces are smooth, tan to pink
and otherwise unremarkable.  The specimen is totally submitted
labeled 2A.

Part 3 labeled "subcarinal node".  Consists of a 2.3 x 2.0 x 1.2
cm. rubbery, tan to pink, grossly enlarged lymph node, with
uniform pink, grossly lymphoid cut surface showing no discrete
lesion.  The specimen is sectioned and totally submitted labeled
3A through 3C.

Part 4 labeled "level 7 node".  Consists of a 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm.
rubbery, ovate, tan to pink node, which is totally submitted
labeled 4A.

Part 5 labeled "left lung". Consists of a 25.3 x 16.8 x 4.1 cm.
total left pneumonectomy, with an attached broad segment of red,
muscular, partially torn diaphragm at the basal aspect, and an 11.5
x 8.7 cm. segment of smooth, pink, focally hemorrhagic
pericardium at the anteromedial aspect.  The specimen has a
total weight of 840 grams.  The lateral surfaces show diffuse,
firm, white, slightly raised nodules ranging from 0.2 to 3.2 cm.
in greatest dimension, separated by smooth, pink segments with
yellow fatty streaking and areas of adhesion, grossly consistent
with parietal pleura.  There is a firm, consolidated mass at the
posterior basal tip, 6.0 cm. in greatest dimension, and a smaller
firm mass at the medial diaphragmatic edge.  The superficial
hilus shows a protruding 2.0 cm. bronchial segment, with a patent
lumen and smooth, pale tan epithelium, as well as grossly patent
pulmonary artery and vein branches, which are secured with
surgical staples.  There are multiple soft, black anthracotic
lymph nodes, 0.6 to 1.0 cm. in greatest dimension, in the
perihilar tissue, and within a patch of soft, yellow, adipose
tissue superior to the pericardium.  

On serial sectioning, there are innumerable, firm, white, dense
and well circumscribed tumor nodules, 0.3 to 3.5 cm. in greatest
dimension, distributed around the lung along the
visceral/parietal pleural interface, and extending between the
lung and diaphragm.  The largest posterior basal mass measures
5.6 cm. in greatest dimension, with dense, white uniform cut
surfaces, and grossly involves the diaphragmatic muscle,
extending to the mid medial resection margin.  The tumor grossly
involves the pericardial tissue but does not invade the inner
surface.  There is extensive confluence of the tumor nodules
along the posterior-medial and -lateral surfaces of the lung, and
there are multiple intraparenchymal firm, white nodules in both
lobes, ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 cm. in greatest dimension.  The
remainder of the lung shows spongy, pink-brown, and focally
anthracotic parenchyma, and peripheral bronchial and vascular
structures are grossly patent.  

Portions of tissue are retained for OCT and bulk tissue banking,
and digital images and gross photographs are taken. 
Representative sections are submitted per the following key:
5A-B -    bronchial and vascular resection margins
5C   -    superficial hilar lymph nodes
5D   -    mediastinal nodes above pericardium
5E   -    interlobar nodes
5F   -    mid medial pericardium and diaphragm with resection
          margin inked
5G-H -    intraparenchymal tumor nodules 
5I   -    superior pericardial edge with margin inked
5J-M -    peripheral upper lobe with surrounding tumor
5N-O -    peripheral lower lobe with tumor
5P-Q -    diaphragm with tumor nodules.

Part 6 labeled "chest wall over 10th rib".  Consists of a 0.9 x
0.4 x 0.3 cm. irregular, soft, tan to white, focally cauterized
tissue segment, totally submitted labeled 6A.

Part 7 labeled "pleural margin".  Consists of a 3.5 x 1.7 cm.
segment of soft, pink, fibromembranous tissue, with patchy
hemorrhage and focal cautery artifact along one edge, ranging
from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. in thickness.  There is no designated
orientation.  The cut surfaces show soft, pale tan to hemorrhagic
tissue, and the specimen is sectioned and totally submitted
labeled 7A and 7B.

Part 8 labeled "old chest tube site".  Consists of a 2.8 x 1.1 x
0.3 cm. unoriented ellipse of rubbery, tan-white skin showing a
well-healed linear scar, with attached soft, lobular yellow
adipose tissue, measuring 4.4 cm. in thickness.  On sectioning,
the skin is dense and tan-white and the underlying fat is grossly
viable.  There is a rubbery, red-brown muscle segment along the
deep margin, 1.5 cm. in thickness which shows focal hemorrhage
and yellow, fatty infiltration.  Representative sections of the
skin and deep muscle tissue are submitted labeled 8A and 8B,
respectively.

PATIENT HISTORY:
PRE OP DIAGNOSIS:  ABDOMINAL MASS
POST OP DIAGNOSIS:  NOT SPECIFIED
PROCEDURE: EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY, EN BLOC RESECTION TRANSVERSE COLON OMENTUM,
EXCISION MULTIPLE TUMOR IMPLANTS, BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY
_______________________________________________________________
AMENDED/CORRECTED REPORT:
At the request of Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU], immunohistochemical studies for CA-125 and
ER/PR were performed.  These were both negative.  However, following
additional study of the case an immunohistochemical stain for calretinin was
performed which proved to be positive in tumor cells.  This latter findings
provides support for a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma which amends the
original report of 1/5/2000.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1-TUMOR IMPLANT:
     UNDIFFERENTIATED MALIGNANT SPINDLE AND EPITHELIOID CELL NEOPLASM (SEE
COMMENT).
2-ABDOMINAL IMPLANT:
     UNDIFFERENTIATED MALIGNANT SPINDLE AND EPITHELIOID CELL NEOPLASM (SEE
COMMENT).
3-COLON AND TUMOR IMPLANT:
     SEGMENT OF COLON WITH UNDIFFERENTIATED MALIGNANT SPINDLE AND EPITHELIOID
CELL NEOPLASM.
     THE RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR (SEE COMMENT).
4-RIGHT OVARY:
     OVARY WITH PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES AND UNREMARKABLE FALLOPIAN TUBE.  NO TUMOR
SEEN.
5-LEFT OVARY:
     OVARY WITH SEROSAL IMPLANT OF MALIGNANT UNDIFFERENTIATED TUMOR (SEE
COMMENT).  THE
     FALLOPIAN TUBE IS UNREMARKABLE.
CLB/CLB
COMMENT:
The tumor is histologically similar in all sites.  Immunohistochemical stains
for cytokeratin, (AE1-3 and CAM52) and vimentin are positive while those for
carcinoembryonic antigen, S-100 protein, malignant melanoma protein
(HMB45),actin, CD 30 and TAG 72-3 are all negative.  This panel of stain
results does not provide a clear diagnostic impression.  An undifferentiated
carcinoma cannot be excluded but malignant mesothelioma and malignant melanoma
are not likely diagnoses.

CLINICAL SUMMARY:
This 85-year-old white woman mentally retarded and non-communicative as she
was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation of chronic pleural
effusions and chronic urinary tract infections on 8/10/00. All her history was
obtained from her medical records sent from the outside hospital. The patient
had been discharged earlier on 8/2/00 with a diagnosis of urinary tract
infection.  She was sent back to the nursing home on Clindamycin and Diflucan.
She was then readmitted on 8/6/00 with fever, increased white blood cell count
and pyuria.  She was started on ampicillin and gentamicin. It was also noted
that she had chronic pleural effusions and right pleural thickening on chest
x-ray and CT scan of the chest.  A low density lesion in the liver and a
staghorn stone in the right kidney were also noted on CT scan.
 
 PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:
 1. Urine culture positive for Enterococcus faecalis on 7/17/00.
 2. Upper GI bleed, 1998
 3. History of MI.
 4. History of pulmonary edema.
 5. History of multiple CVA's including a cerebellar CVA seen on MRI and a
previous right frontal and left temporal CVA.
 6. Hypertension.
 7. Hip fracture.
 8. Cataract surgery.
 
 MEDICATIONS: Zestril, Clindamycin, Clonidine, Lopressor, Prempro, Prevacid,
Nitropatch, Multivitamin, Lactulose, Metamucil, Os-Cal.
 
The patient lived in a nursing home. Family history and review of systems
could not be obtained. 
 
On physical examination the patient was unable to speak or  to follow
commands.  She had contractures of both hands. Blood pressure was 151/64,
pulse 84, respiratory rate 40, temperature 36.0. The Heart had regular rate
and rhythm.  The lung had  basilar crackles, some decreased breath sounds on
the right side.
She had tachypnea at a rate of 40; however, her oxygen saturation was
adequate.
Later that day 8/10/00, the patient suffered from respiratory failure and was
transferred to the MICU and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
The patient was hypotensive and required institution of vasopressor therapy. 
Her blood pressure was 81/37 on phenylephrine. She also developed acute renal
failure with BUN 64, and creatinine 6.5. Her white blood cell count was 23,600
but was afebrile. Blood and urine cultures were negative . Nevertheless, she
was placed on wide spectrum antibiotics including Unasyn
(ampicillin/sulbactam).
During her course in the hospital the patient also had melenic stools and
developed anemia with hemoglobin down to 7.2 and hematocrit down to 21.9 and
MCV of 76.3 on 8/25/00. Blood taken on 8/24/00 grew Enterococcus
Faecalis/Faecium and the patient was switched to Zosyn
(piperacillin/tazobactam). She continued to have high white blood cell count.
On 8/28/00 the patient was transferred to the MICU after she became hypoxemic,
hypotensive and tachycardic. She was intubated and placed on dopamine. She
developed wide complex tachycardia and was cardioverted with 200 J. She
continued to suffer from renal failure with creatinine level of 6.5 and BUN of
64.
After discussing the patient's condition with the family and the nursing home,
it was decided that given her terminal illness, the most compassionate thing
to do is withdraw all life support measures.
She was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Vasopressors were stopped.
The patient died of respiratory arrest at midnight on 8/30/00.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
The endocardium of the right ventricle has fibrous thickening and several foci
 of calcification. The left  shows mild fibrosis . The Lt anterior coronary
artery had a partly calcified intimal plaque that reduces the lumen.
   
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
The majority of the patient' s tumor involves the rt. lung and chest wall and
is made uo pf spindle cells that  have large nuclei and scant cytoplasm,
Abundant collagen is also present and there are numerous foci of necrotic
tumor. A panel of immunoperoxidase stains were carried out: those positive are
Calretinin (focally) and Cytokeratin 5/6. Those negative include 2 CEA stains,
LeuM1, and the TAG and BEREP stains. The block that was used for these stains
was from a liver metastasis, block K. Metastases from the tumor were present
in the heart and pericardium associated with fibrinous pericarditis, a
microscopic focus in the left lung, some of the tracheobronchial lymphnodes,
in marrow from the spine, the liver, the mesothelial surface of the small
bowel mesentery, and the floor of the pelvis. The mucosa of the stomach and
the right adrenal gland. 
The additional changes in the lungs are deposits oif anthracotic pigment ,
dilated blood vessels and air spaces., and in the left lung there is a

PATIENT HISTORY:
The patient presented with multiple, soft tissue masses in the
abdominal/peritoneal cavity and pelvis.  CT scan reveals no liver, pancreatic,
adrenal, splenic, or gallbladder masses.  Fine needle biopsies at outside
institution with diagnosis positive for malignant neoplasm.
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS:  Carcinoma.
POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same.
PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparoscopy.
_______________________________________________________________
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1:  Gallbladder, excision 
     A. MILD CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS AND CHOLESTEROLOSIS.
     B. NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASM.
PARTS 2 AND 3:  Right Colon, ILEUM, SIGMOID COLON, LEFT COLON and OMENTUM,

     A. EPITHELIOID malignant mesothelioma EXTENSIVELY INVOLVING AND ENCASING
ILEUM; RIGHT, SIGMOID, AND LEFT COLON; APPENDIX; OMENTUM; AND MESENTERY.
B. NEOPLASM PRESENT ON PERITONEAL SURFACE AT MULTIPLE VISCERAL RESECTION
MARGINS (see comment).
LAN/LAN
COMMENT:
The tumor is composed of multiple, variably-sized nodules of epithelioid cells
with prominent nucleoli that have microcystic, tubular and papillary growth
patterns.  Involvement is almost completely restricted to the peritoneal
surface, without evidence of a mucosal origin in any of the resected viscera. 
In addition to the immunohistochemical stains performed and reported on the
previous specimen (***PATH-NUMBER[1]), seven stains (cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and 20,
chromogranin, synaptophysin, NSE, inhibin and calretinin) were performed
and/or repeated on the current specimen. The results were as follows:
cytokeratins AE1/AE3 (strongly), calretinin (strongly) and NSE (focally) are
positive; cytokeratin 20, chromogranin, synaptophysin and inhibin are
negative.  In combination with the previously-reported immunomorphological
findings, the findings in the current specimen are consistent with malignant
mesothelioma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in 3 parts.
Part 1 received unfixed with the patient's name, initials JM, labeled
"gallbladder", and consists of a single, smooth, bile stained gallbladder, 7.5
cm in length comes 4.5 cm open circumference containing approximately 3 cc of
a viscous dark green bile and no stones.  The mucosal surface is smooth with
diffuse yellow streaking, with a wall thickness is approximately 0 .1 cm. and
1.3 cm of attached cystic duct is 1.5 cm in open circumference and free of
obstruction.  Representative sections are submitted labeled 1A.
Part 2 received unfixed with the patient's name, initials JM, labeled "right
colon", and consists of a resection of terminal ileum with attached colon,
appendix and omentum. The peritoneal surfaces are studded by pink-white, soft,
round tissue mass is ranging from 0.3 to 15.0 x 10.0 x 1.0 cm.
The terminal ileum, 3.5 cm in length is 3.0 cm in open circumference with
grossly normal appearing mucosa.  The colon, 46.0 cm in length ranges from 7.0
to 8.0 cm in circumference with unremarkable, tan mucosa.  The bowel segments
are surrounded by pink-white tumor abutting the muscularis, with no obvious
mural involvement.  The appendix is completely surrounded by tumor but the
lumen and wall are grossly uninvolved on extensive serial sectioning.  The
mesentery has extensive tumor studding with nodules ranging from 0.3 to 10.0
cm in greatest dimension.  No other abnormalities are seen.  The ileal and
colonic margins of resection are free of tumor.  Representative tissue is
banked.  Digital images are taken.  The following sections are submitted:
2A. terminal ileum, proximal resection margin, shave
2B.  D. appendix with surrounding tumor (entire appendiceal tip submitted)
2E.  F. random colon with adjacent tumor
2G. colon, distal resection margin, shave
2H.  I. tumor face
2J. mesenteric fat with adherent tumor
Part 3 received unfixed with the patient's name, initials JM, labeled "small
bowel, sigmoid colon, left colon, omentum", and consists of the en bloc
resection of two small bowel segments, one large bowel segment and attached
omentum with surrounding, pink-white tumor nodules.  Overall dimensions are
40.0 x 28.0 x 10.0 cm.  On further dissection the small bowel segments are
16.0 and 25.0 cm in length with circumferences ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 cm.
there are adherent, pink-white tumor nodules ranging from 0.3 to 10.0 cm in
greatest dimension with no obvious mucosal involvement.  The large bowel, 43.0
cm in length, ranges from 5.0 to 6.0 cm in circumference and is completely
surrounded by pink-white, soft, partially necrotic tumor, 23.0 x 16.0 x 10.0
cm, which also involves the adherent omental apron.  The small bowel and
colonic margins of resection are grossly free of tumor.  Representative tissue
is banked.  The following sections are submitted:
3A.  B. small bowel, 16-cm segment, resection margins, shaved
3C.  D. small bowel, 25 cm segment, resection margins, shaved
3E.  F. small bowel with surrounding tumor

Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 **PLACE, IL)
RESULTS:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on this mesothelial
neoplasm demonstrate 16 (26.2%) cells with homozygous loss and 4 (6.6%) of
cells with hemizygous loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of
chromosome 9 was 0.68. The targeted region (total 61 cells) is considered to
be POSITIVE  for p16 (9p21) deletion. 
Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9:      
Normal Range Ratio:  0.85-1.19
Normal % deletion: less than 20%
Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16
deletion in malignant mesotheliomas.

COMMENT:
Immunohistochemical stains were done to better categorize the tumor. They
show: Glut-1  negative, D2-40  positive, p16  positive, WT-1  positive, and
CK5/6  positive. 
FISH analysis shows p16 deletion.
The findings are that of a mesothelial neoplasm. The bulk of the tumor shows a
pattern similar to well differentiated papillary mesothelioma with some areas
highly suspicious for superficial stromal invasion. Taken together the
molecular and histologic findings are best characterized as malignant
mesothelioma with extensive papillary configuration. 
The case was reviewed at the weekly intradepartmental gastrointestinal
pathology consensus conference 8-22-2008.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a 63-year-old man presenting with pleural thickening (?
mesothelioma). 
SOURCE OF SPECIMEN:
1: PLEURA, LEFT, CT-GUIDED FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY
2: LEFT PLEURA, CT GUIDED BIOPSY WITH TOUCH PREPARATION
__________________________________________________________________________
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  PLEURA, LEFT, CT-GUIDED FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY:
SATISFACTORY FOR INTERPRETATION.
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, BIPHASIC. 
  
2.  LEFT PLEURA, CT GUIDED BIOPSY WITH TOUCH PREPARATION:
SATISFACTORY FOR INTERPRETATION.
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, BIPHASIC, See comment.
COMMENT:
The specimen shows highly atypical biphasic epithelial and spindle cells with
hyperchromasia, necrosis, and occasional cytoplasmic vacuoles. Immunostain
study shows positive staining for calretinin (cytoplasmic and nuclear
staining), WT1 (nuclear staining), Ki67 (70% of tumor nuclei), and negative
immunostain for BerEp4, B72.3, CK7, CK20, Glut 1, TTF 1, and P16. These
results support the diagnosis. Additional stains are in progress and the
results to follow as addendum.
 
This case was also reviewed by Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] who agrees with the above
interpretation.

"Explanation of Primary Non-Gynecologic Cytopathology Diagnostic Categories:
The "Negative for Malignant Cells" category reflects the benign nature of the
specimen.  However, there are occasional False Negative cases due to problems
with sampling, processing, screening, interpretation, or clinical correlation.
 The "Atypical Cells Present" and "Suspicious for Malignant Cells" categories
are indeterminate categories with increasing degrees of positive predictive
value.  The "Positive for Malignant Cells" category is placed on cases which
fulfill the malignant criteria for that particular organ site.  However,
specific typing, presence or absence of invasion, and other
diagnostic/prognostic information may require additional procedures."

_______________________________________________________________
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimens are received fresh in eight parts.
Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials AMD and "spleen, tail of
pancreas, omentum".  It consists of a resection of omentum with attached
spleen (no tail of pancreas grossly identified), which measures 57.0 x 27.0 x
5.5 cm.  The spleen measures 16.6 x 10.8 x 6.8 cm.  The surface of the omentum
shows multiple white slightly raised areas, which range in measure from <0.1
cm to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension.  The external surface of the spleen show
multiple pale tan areas of plaque, which range in measure from 0.2 cm to 2.0
cm in greatest dimension.  Upon sectioning of the omentum, multiple firm pale
yellow areas are identified. Seven lymph nodes are identified in the splenic
hilum, which range in measure from 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm to 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. 
Upon sectioning of the spleen, no lesions are grossly identified. 
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

consists of an apparent gallbladder, which measures 7.5 x 4.8 x 3.0 cm. The
external surface shows focally cauterized areas, otherwise smooth and
unremarkable.  Upon sectioning the gallbladder is filled with thick viscous
dark green fluid.  The anterior wall thickness ranges in measure from <0.1 to
0.8 cm in thickness and is dark green and velvety with no apparent lesions. 
No stones or extractions are identified in the neck of the gallbladder. 
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

which includes a 1.8 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm kidney with minimal surrounding adipose
tissue with a partial nephrectomy portion previously removed. The specimen is
bisected from the side opposite the hilum. The cut surface reveals a cystic
structure in the periphery of the kidney parenchyma measuring 1.9 x 1.2 cm in
greatest dimension and filled with thick yellow/green gelatinous material. The
remainder of the renal cortex is red-brown with distinct cortical medullary
junction. The renal pelvis is lined by smooth, glistening mucosa. The adrenal
gland is not present.  A representative section of normal kidney is submitted
for possible further molecular studies. Representative sections are submitted
as submitted as follows:
6A - ureteral and vascular margins

ADDENDA:
Addendum     
Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 **PLACE, IL)
RESULTS:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on the malignant
mesothelioma demonstrates 5(6.8%) cells with homozygous loss and 27(36.5%) of
cells with hemizygous loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of
chromosome 9 was 0.73. The targeted region (total 74 cells) is considered to
be POSITIVE for p16 (9p21) deletion. 
Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9:      
Normal Range Ratio:  0.85-1.19
Normal % deletion: less than 20%
Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16
deletion in malignant mesotheliomas.

COMMENT:
Intraoperative frozen sections were performed on part 2 and reported as
"benign".  But permanent sections show malignant mesothelioma.  The original
frozen slides were reviewed and the discrepancy was due to suboptimal quality
and sampling error.  Dr. **NAME[QQQ] who performed the frozen was notified by
e-mail on 12/19/2008.  
Dr. **NAME[SSS] has reviewed the case and concurs with above diagnosis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in formalin in a 5 parts from **INSTITUTION.
Part 1 is received in formalin after intraoperative consultation labeled with
the patient's name, and initials JTS, and "omentum".  It consists of a 4.7 x
1.5 x 1.0 cm portion of lobulated, focally hemorrhagic adipose tissue. 
Sectioning reveals a nodular, slightly firm cut surface.  Multiple
representative sections are submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section
tissue is resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette 1AFS, and additional
sections are submitted in cassette 1B.
Part 2 is received in formalin following intraoperative consultation labeled
with the patient's name, and initials and JTS, and "right abdominal wall
peritoneum".  It consists of a 7.3 x 4.8 x 0.4 cm irregular sheet of thickened
tan-gray fibromembranous tissue.  One surface is predominantly smooth and
hemorrhagic maroon red while the opposing surface is shaggy, and vaguely
nodular.  At time of intraoperative consultation 3 representative sections are
submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section tissue is resubmitted for
permanent sections in cassette 2AFS, and 3 additional sections are submitted
in cassette 2B.
Part 3 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials JTS,
and "right abdominal wall peritoneum".  It consists of an irregular, 10.5 x
6.0 x 0.3 cm sheet of fibromembranous tissue.  One surface is smooth to
focally hemorrhagic while the opposing surface has areas of slight fibrous
thickening and is shaggy.  No discrete measurable lesion is identified. 
Multiple representative sections are submitted in cassettes 3A and 3B.
Part 4 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials JTS,
and "left abdominal wall, pericolic".  It consists of a markedly irregular
sheet of fibromembranous tissue measuring 20.0 x 6.0 x 0.5 cm in greatest
dimensions.  One surface is predominantly smooth and hemorrhagic maroon red
except for a few areas where there is slight shaggy, papilliferous induration.
 The opposing surface is diffusely shaggy tan-gray with areas of marked
fibrous thickening.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:
4A     -     section through areas of papilliferous discoloration on otherwise
smooth surface
4B     -     sections through areas of fibrous thickening
Part 5 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials JTS,
and "omentum".  It consists of two irregular sheets of apparent distorted
omentum measuring 14.0 x 6.0 x 1 .5 cm, and 15.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm.  The omental
fragments are covered by markedly hemorrhagic surfaces.  A few areas of shaggy
tan-gray fibrous thickening and disruption are identified measuring up to 4.0
cm in diameter.  Sectioning through the omental fragments reveals areas of
intervening tan-gray fibrous-like tissue and a moderate amount of hemorrhage. 
Gross digital images are obtained, and representative sections are submitted
in cassettes 5A and 5B

ADDENDA:
Addendum     
Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 **PLACE, IL)
RESULTS:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on the malignant
mesothelioma demonstrate 63(92.6%) cells with homozygous loss and 1(1.5%) of
cells with hemizygous loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of
chromosome 9 was 0.06. The targeted region (total 68 cells) is considered to
be POSITIVE for p16 (9p21) deletion. 
Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9:      
Normal Range Ratio:  0.85-1.19
Normal % deletion: less than 20%
Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16
deletion in malignant mesotheliomas.

_______________________________________________________________
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in formalin in six parts, each in a properly labeled
container.
Part one is labeled with the patient' s name, initials BDC and "spleen and
omentum".  It consists of a splenectomy with attached omental tissues, the
spleen is 504 grams and measures 15.0 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm.  Vasculature at the
hilum is unremarkable.  The pathologist is consulted.  The capsular surface of
the spleen is smooth, glistening and dusky dark purple.  Multiple serial
sections show normal appearing dark purple-brown parenchyma.  The vasculature
is unremarkable.  No lesions or nodules are noted.  The portion of attached
red-yellow lobulated omental tissue aggregates 25.0 x 13.0 x 6.5 cm.  A single
mass is palpated at the periphery, well away from the splenic attachment. 
This mass is fairly well defined, composed of pink-yellow tissues and is 3.1 x
2.6 x 3.0 cm.  Remaining cut surfaces are composed of yellow lobulated
tissues.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1A x multiple-splenic hilar vasculature and possible lymph nodes
1B-1C x 1 each-spleen
1D-1E x 1 each-omental mass
1Fx 1-random omental tissue.
Part two is labeled with the patient' s name, initials BDC and "gallbladder". 
It consists of a collapsed gallbladder, 7.0 cm. in length and 2.3 cm. in
diameter at the distal fundus.  A serosal aspect is green-purple, focally
congested and with evidence of adhesions.  The stump of cystic duct is 0.2 cm.
in diameter and appears stenotic.  Adjacent to the cystic duct is a 0.6 x 0.4
x 0.4 cm. pink-tan lymph node.  The mucosal surface is bile stained and
velvety.  Stone material is not present.  The wall is up to 0.2 cm. in
thickness.  Representative sections are submitted in two cassettes as follows:
2A x 4-cystic duct and entire lymph node
2B x 2-mid segment and distal fundus of gallbladder.
Part three is labeled with the patient' s name, initials BDC and "small bowel
nodule".  It consists of a pink-tan firm nodule, 1.0 cm. in diameter. 
Covering one surface is unremarkable mucosa, 2.0 x 1.0 cm.  The tissue is
bisected and the nodule appears well defined and composed of firm white
tissues.  There is no extension into the mucosa.  Tissue is entirely submitted
in a cassette labeled 3A.
3A x 4-entirely submitted.
Part four is labeled with the patient' s name, initials BDC and "sigmoid colon
resection".  It consists of an unoriented segment of colon, 36.0 cm. in length
with an abundant amount of red-yellow lobulated fatty tissue attached.  There
is significant evidence of adhesions especially at one resected margin and
extending 10.0 cm.  One resected margin is open (with adhesions) and the
opposite resected margin is closed with staples.  At mid segment there is
again evidence of adhesions with scant focal exudate.  The segment is opened
lengthwise and the pathologist consulted.  The stapled margin is most likely
proximal and the open resected margin is distal.  An obstructing submucosal
mass extending to the radial resected margin is present 1.0 cm. from the open
(distal) resected margin, this mass is fairly well defined and composed of
pale yellow firm tissues, 4.5 cm. in length, up to 3.0 cm. in thickness and
4.5 cm. in circumference.  The circumference at this margin is 6.0 cm.  The
mass is inked green and the resected margin is inked blue.  A white
cylindrical structure is also noted adjacent to the mass along the radial
margin and is 3.2 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter.  It lies 6.0 cm from
the colon resected margin.  Along the remaining length, extending proximally
are focal indurated fatty tissues and implant nodules composed of pale
yellow-white firm tissues with no gross extension into the mucosal tissues. 
These areas are present 9.0 cm. from the proximal resected margin and are most
prominent at mid segment.  No mucosal lesions are noted.  The bowel wall
averages 0.3 cm. and the circumference at the proximal resected margin is 8.0
cm.  The separate implant nodules/tissues measure up to 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. 
Cut sections through the fatty tissues show normal appearing vasculature. 
Thirteen lymph nodes are identified within the fatty tissues measuring up to
0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.  Five of the lymph nodes are firm by palpation. 
Representative sections are submitted in eleven cassettes as follows:
4A x 2-proximal resected margin (stapled)
4B-4C x 1 each-perpendicular distal resected margins (open)
4D x 1-distal mass, submucosal
4E x 1-distal mass, cross section with radial resected margin inked
4F x 3-indurated fatty tissues mid segment
4G-4H x 1 each-implants mid segment
4I-4J x 4 each-four lymph nodes each, eight total
4K x 5-five lymph nodes intact.
Part five is labeled with the patient' s name, initials BDC and "right colon".
 It consists of a segment of right colon and cecum (15.0 cm. in length) with a
tortuous segment of terminal ileum attached; 25.0 cm. in length.  There are
self adhesions of the small bowel with obvious stricture.  The appendix is at
the usual location of the cecal pouch.  There are adhesions of the cecal
serosa.  A minimal amount of fatty tissue is attached.  Both resected margins
are closed with multiple staples.  The segment is opened lengthwise and the
pathologist is consulted.  The circumference of the small bowel is 6.0 cm and
that of the right colon/cecum is 7.5 cm and 15.0 cm, respectively.  The area
of self adhesions and stricture is present 6.0 cm. from the proximal resected
margin and affects approximately 11 cm. of the small bowel.  The self adhesion
is associated with small bowel submucosal implants composed of pale yellow
tissue, the nodular areas measure up to 3.0 x 2.2 x 1.0 cm.  These implant
tissues are present 9.0 cm. from the proximal resected margin and 3.0 cm. from
the ileal cecal valve.  Otherwise no mucosal lesions are noted.  The ileal
cecal valve is unremarkable as well as the mucosa of the cecum and right
colon.  The attached appendix is 4.2 cm. in length and 0.5 cm. in diameter. 
Cut sections show an obliterated appendix with an abundant amount of indurated
fatty tissue surrounding it.  Sixteen lymph nodes are identified on cut
sections ranging in size from 0.2 cm. in greatest dimension to 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5
cm.  Representative sections are submitted in fifteen cassettes as follows:
5A x 1-proximal resected margin
5B x 1-distal resected margin
5C-5D x 1 each-small bowel implants, mid segment of small bowel
5E x 1-cecal pouch
5F x 1-ileal cecal valve
5G-5H x 3 total-right colon/cecum adhesions
5I x 3-appendix
5J x 4-one lymph node
5K x 3-one lymph node
5L x 2-one lymph node
5M x 6-six lymph nodes
5N x 4-four lymph nodes
5O x 3-three possible lymph nodes.
Part six is labeled with the patient' s name, initials BDC and "miscellaneous
peritoneum".  It consists of multiple irregular portions of red-yellow
lobulated fibromembranous and adipose tissues aggregating 18.0 x 12.0 x 6.0
cm.  Nodules, induration and possible lymph nodes are identified comprising
less than 10% of the entire tissues submitted.  The largest lymph node is 0.5
cm. in greatest dimension and the largest induration/nodule is 0.8 cm. in
greatest dimension.  Representative sections are submitted in four cassettes
labeled 6A-6D.

MAM/MAM
COMMENT:
Parts 1 and 5:  The mesothelioma shows several interesting features.  First,
there is a very minor epithelioid component to the mesothelioma seen best with
immunostains for cytokeratin 5/6 and also reflected in the organization of
mesothelial cells in the adherent pleura and hemorrhage.  Second, this
fibrosarcomatous mesothelioma has a very distinct hemangiopericytoma-like
growth pattern, which is unusual for diffuse malignant mesothelioma.  Because
of this, I have performed fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies for the
translocation associated with synovial sarcoma and this study is negative,
providing further support for a diagnosis of mesothelioma over that of a chest
wall synovial sarcoma.  Third, this mesothelioma is associated with
calcification, although I do not see distinct ossification.  From an
immunohistochemical point of view, the mesothelioma expresses cytokeratin and
also shows focal expression for nuclear calretinin, WT-1, D2-40 and
cytokeratin 5/6, while failing to show positivity with antibodies directed at
carcinoembryonic antigen, Leu-M1, B72.3, TTF-1, CD34, CD31, S100 protein,
desmon, synaptophysin, renal cell carcinoma antigen and epithelial membrane
antigen.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in 4 parts from **INSTITUTION.
Specimen 1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the
patient's name, initials JN, and "right pleural biopsy".  It consists of a 3.0
x 2.0 x 0.5 cm aggregate of tan-gray finely nodular fibromembranous tissue and
some appended adipose tissue.  No discrete lesions are identified. 
Approximately  one half of the specimen is submitted for frozen section.  The
frozen section tissue is resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette 1AFS,
and an additional representative portion is submitted in cassette 1B.
Specimen 2 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials
JN, and "right pleura".  It consists of 3 irregular sheets of mottled tan to
tan-brown membranous tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.4 x 0 .2 cm, 2.5 x 1.0 x 0 .15
cm, and 2.7 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm.  The smaller and larger fragment appears nodular
throughout while the midsized fragment is predominantly resilient, and smooth.
 A representative portion to include the entire smaller and largest fragment
are submitted in cassette 2A.
Specimen 3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the
patient's name, initials JN, and "wedge right lower lobe".  Post consultation
the specimen consists of 3 irregular fragments of tan-brown tissue each with
embedded staples measuring 0.3, 0.3, and 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm each in greatest
dimensions.  The smaller two fragments have little soft tissue.  The tissue
near the staple line has been previously marked green on all 3 fragments.  The
remaining tissue is nodular, irregular and ranges from pale tan to tan-brown. 
A representative section is submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section
tissue is resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette 3AFS, and additional
sections are submitted as follows:
3B     -     remaining larger fragment
3C     -     tissue removed from staple line (margin)
Specimen 4 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials
JN, and "wedge of right lower lobe, Oncotech and Precision".  It consists of a
3.0 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm wedge resection of lung having a staple line along one
edge.  The pleural surface is mottled tan to gray purple with areas of vague
tan-gray nodularity.  Sectioning reveals multiple adjacent small subpleural
tan-grey nodules ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 cm in diameter.  These have firm
tan-gray cut surfaces each extending to within less than 0.1 cm of the pleural
surface.  Grossly they also extend to within 0.2 cm of the stapled resection
margin.  Due to the small size tissue is not harvested for Oncotech or
Precision Therapeutics.
INKING KEY:
Resection margin-black
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
4A     -     shaved tissue from resection margin/staple line
4B     -     multiple cross-sections to include all mottled

LAK/LAK
COMMENT:
The immunostaining performed on block 5B reveal the following
immunohistochemical characteristics:
D2-40          Pending, results to follow. 
Calretinin     Strongly positive
Cytokeratin 5/6     Strongly positive
CEA          Negative
B72.3 (BRST3)     Rare focal positivity
In view of the above staining and review of prior abdominal and liver biopsies
(***PATH-NUMBER[1]), diagnosis of mesothelioma is favored.  The morphology of the
present residual tumor is epithelioid in nature, however the majority of the
nodules  show a benign appearing fibrohyalinized nodules. In contrast to this
morphology, the previous biopsied lesion shows extensive sarcomatoid
differentiation (***PATH-NUMBER[1]).  The tumor seen in the present specimen is
probably related to post chemotherapy effect and there is very little viable
tumor tissues left in the present specimen.  Possibility of a mixed
sarcomatoid and epithelioid mesothelioma cannot be completely excluded. 
Please correlate clinically.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in formalin in five parts.
Part one is labeled with the patient' s name, initials JLB and "spleen and
omentum".  It consists of a grossly identifiable spleen measuring 17.0 x 9.9 x
5.8 cm. with partially attached minimally hemorrhagic yellow lobular tissue
fragments measuring 28.0 x 16.0 x 2.5 cm. in aggregate.  The yellow lobular
tissue is focally hyperemic with shaggy, hemorrhagic areas.  On palpation
multiple pink-white firm nodules are identified within the tissue ranging from
1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. up to 3.4 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm.  Cut surface of the nodular
areas are solid and pink-white.  The largest nodule has a central area of
yellow discoloration.  After removal of the omental tissues, the spleen itself
weighs 345 grams.  The capsule is purple and smooth with fine adhesions and a
0.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. translucent cystic structure.  Along one aspect there is a
5.0 x 1.8 cm. raised, shaggy area, also associated with small translucent
cystic structures up to 0.5 cm.  The vessels at the hilum are unremarkable. 
Within the fatty tissues at the hilum, a 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm portion of yellow
lobular possible pancreatic tissue is noted.  Sectioning of the spleen shows
glistening purple parenchyma with no discrete lesions or areas of induration. 
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1A-1D x multiple-representative sections of nodule in omental tissue
1E-1F x 2 each-cystic structures/shaggy area on splenic capsule
1G x 2-representative sections of blood vessels at hilum and possible
pancreatic tissue 
1H-1K x multiple, additional section of nodular tissue in omentum
Part two is labeled with the patient' s name, initials JLB and "small bowel".
It consists of a grossly identifiable, unoriented tortuous segment of small
bowel measuring 42.0 cm. in length with stapled resected ends.  The bowel is
adherent to itself and to the small amount of attached mesenteric tissues. 
The serosa is focally shaggy and hemorrhagic, particularly in the mid portion
and extending over the mesenteric tissues.  There are multiple tan-white
indurated nodules extending over the surface and mesenteric tissues, ranging
form 0.4 cm. up to 5.0 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm.  The nodules come to within 1.5 cm. of
its nearest stapled margin.  Cut surface of the nodules are tan-white and
solid.  On opening, the bowel mucosa is pink-tan and folded. There are small
pink-tan nodular areas on the mucosa, immediately overlying the largest tan
white nodule. This poorly defined area measures approximately 3.8 x 1.5 cm. 
No other mucosal lesions are noted.  The open circumference of the bowel
averages 6.5 cm.  The bowel wall averages 0.2 cm. with no diverticula. 
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
2A-2B x 1 each-margins, shaved
2C-2D x 3-representative sections of nodules on serosa
2E-2G x 1 each-representative sections of largest nodule with possible mucosal
involvement
2H x 2-additional representative sections of bowel.
2I -2L x multiple, additional sections of nodules
Part three is labeled with the patient' s name, initials JLB and "appendix". 
It consists of a vermiform appendix measuring 7.8 cm. in length and ranging
from 0.8 up to 1.2 cm. in diameter.  A minimal amount of yellow lobular
mesoappendix is attached.  The serosal surface is pink-tan, hemorrhagic and
shaggy, particularly in the distal portion.  There are multiple tan-white
small nodules over the serosa and attached fatty tissues, ranging from 0.1 cm.
up to 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm.  On sectioning, the lumen is minimally dilated and
filled with pink-tan fluid.  The wall averages 0.2 cm. in thickness. 
Representative sections are submitted in cassette 3A.
3A x 4-appendix including proximal end, two sections from mid portion with
nodules and distal tip bisected with nodules.
Part four is labeled with the patient' s name, initials JLB and "gallbladder".
 It consists of an 8.5 x 3.4 x 3.0 cm. grossly identifiable minimally
collapsed gallbladder.  The serosal surface is green stained and smooth with a
0.2 x 0.2 cm. full thickness defect.  The duct measures 0.2 cm. in diameter
and is patent.  This resected end is opened.  On opening, the gallbladder
contains abundant viscus green bile but no stones are identified.  The mucosal
surface is green stained and web like with no lesions.  The wall averages 0.2
cm. in thickness.  Representative sections are submitted in cassette 4A.
4A x 3-gallbladder.

AMENDED/CORRECTED REPORT:
Amended date:  February 22, 2010.
On reviewing the multiple addenda issued on this report, I noticed that the
diagnostic line in Parts 2 and 4 indicated that the diffuse malignant
mesothelium was classified as a mixed epithelioid and "hypersarcomatous type".
 This misspelling of "fibrosarcomatous" has been corrected in the amended
report.  
Original sign-out date:  February 3, 2010.
This Amended Report supersedes all prior reports under this accession number

Addendum     
Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 **PLACE, IL)
RESULTS:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on the biopsy demonstrate
 26(41.9%) cells with homozygous loss and 12(19.4%) of cells with hemizygous
loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of chromosome 9 was 0.40. The
targeted region (total 62 cells) is considered to be POSITIVE for p16 (9p21)
deletion. 
Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9:      
Normal Range Ratio:  0.85-1.19
Normal % deletion: less than 20%
Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16
deletion in malignant mesotheliomas. 
FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis
of a minimum of 60 cells.

COMMENT:
The diffuse malignant mesothelioma has both an epithelioid and
fibrosarcomatous component, and invades both soft tissue / adipose tissue, as
well as extends into minute strips of lung tissue adherent to the pleural
biopsy.  The neoplastic cells express cytokeratin 7, 5/6 and nuclear
calretinin and WT1 and cytoplasmic D2-40  predominantly in the epithelioid
component.  Stains for WT1 and cytokeratin 5/6 are pending.  Immunostains for
carcinoembryonic antigen, TTF-1, B72.3, and BER-EP4 are negative.  Focal
desmin positivity is noted particularly in the spindle component, while S-100
immunostains are negative.

COMMENT:
Part 6:  The tumor seen in the omentum consists of multiple microscopic foci
of well-differentiated malignant mesothelioma infiltrating within the
fibroadipose tissue. The tumor deposits are grossly inapparent (6 out of 7
representative sections contain microscopic tumor). An immunohistochemical
stain for calretinin highlights the scattered microscopic foci.  An
immunohistochemical stain for CD68 demonstrates few foci of histiocytes.  
The tumor seen in the current case is histologically similar to the patient' s
previous material (***PATH-NUMBER[1]).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in 6 parts.
Part 1 is received in a formalin filled container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number, initials NJW, and "previous scar".  It consists
of two gray white skin ellipses measuring 3.0 x 0.5 and 9.5 x 0.4 cm and
excised to a depth of 0.4 cm.  Located on the larger skin surface is a linear
well-healed scar measuring 0.9 cm in greatest dimension.  The fragments are
serially sectioned to reveal a gray-white homogeneous cut surface.  No
discrete lesions are identified.  Representative sections are submitted in
cassette 1A.
Part 2 is received in a formalin filled container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number, initials NJW, and "falciform ligament".  It is of
a single fragment of tan-yellow lobulated soft tissue measuring 7.0 x 5.5 x
0.8 cm.  The specimen is partially surfaced by purple gray membranous soft
tissue.  The fragment is serially sectioned to reveal a tan-yellow homogeneous
cut surface with two white well-circumscribed nodules measuring 1.0 and 1.2 cm
in greatest dimension.  The remaining cut surface is grossly unremarkable. 
Representative sections of the specimen with the nodules are submitted in
cassettes 2A-C.
Part 3 is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name,
medical record number, initials NJW, and "peritoneal biopsy".  It consists of
a single fragment of tan yellow soft tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm.  The
specimen is submitted in toto for intraoperative consult and the remaining
embedding in cassette 3AFS.
Part 4 is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name,
medical record number, initials NJW, and "peritoneal nodule".  It consists of
a single tan yellow well encapsulated nodule measuring 0.9 x 0.3 x 0.6 cm. The
nodule is bisected to reveal a tan-brown homogeneous cut surface.  One half of
the specimen is submitted for touch prep intraoperative consult and the other
half is submitted for frozen section intraoperative consult.
Sections are submitted as follows:
4AFS: touch prep section, in toto
4BFS: frozen section, in toto
Part 5 is received in a formalin filled container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number, initials NJW, and "peritoneal biopsy".  It
consists of a single fragment of tan yellow fibrofatty soft tissue measuring
1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.  The fragment is bisected to reveal a tan-yellow cut
surface with a single well-circumscribed white nodule measuring 0.4 cm in
greatest dimension.  The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 5A.
Part 6 is received in a formalin filled container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number, initials NJW, and "omentum".  It consists of a
single fragment of tan yellow lobulated adipose tissue measuring 27.0 x 15.0 x
1.0 cm. The surface is tan-yellow and glistening with two areas of gray-white
irregular thickening measuring 1.5 to 15 cm in greatest dimension.  The
specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a tan-yellow homogeneous cut surface
with a possible single well-circumscribed tan nodule measuring 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension.  The remaining cut surface is grossly unremarkable. The

Addendum     
Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 **PLACE, IL)
RESULTS:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on the peritoneal
mesothelioma demonstrate 65(100%) cells with homozygous loss and 0(0%) of
cells with hemizygous loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of
chromosome 9 was 0.0. The targeted region (total 65 cells) is considered to be
POSITIVE for p16 (9p21) deletion. 
Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9:      
Normal Range Ratio:  0.85-1.19
Normal % deletion: less than 20%
Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16
deletion in malignant mesotheliomas. 
p16 (9p21)  FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed
by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the p16  SpectrumOrange and the
CEP9  SpectrumGreen probes.

COMMENT:
Parts 1-5:  The clinical history of prior debulking with chemoperfusion and
systemic chemotherapy is noted. The tumor is composed of large, pleomorphic
epithelioid cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm and areas with large
round to oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli; focal nuclear grooves and
intranuclear inclusions are noted.  Numerous mitotic figures are present (>5
/50 hpf).  Areas of necrosis are noted.  Most of the tumor appears to be
superficially invasive with a pushing border.  There are numerous tumor
nodules within the mesentery and peritoneum. The three tumor nodules are round
deposits within the mesenteric fat, with one nodule demonstrating a rim of
lymphocytes. It is difficult to determine whether these nodules represent
tumor deposits or lymph nodes completely replaced by tumor. 
Pathologic parameters  
- Depth of invasion:  Predominantly superficial (=0.5 mm) 
- Prominent desmoplasia:  No
- Mitotic count: >5/50 hpf 
- Nuclear grade: High
- Lymph node metastases:Yes
- Sarcomatoid component:No
The tumor cells are positive for calretinin and WT-1 and negative for CEA,
BER-EP4 and Cytokeratin 5/6 confirming the diagnosis of a peritoneal
mesothelioma. 
p16 analysis by FISH has been ordered and the results will be reported in an
addendum.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PLEURA, LEFT, BIOPSY 
DIFFUSE MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, BIPHASIC TYPE.
SAY/cef
CEF/CEF
COMMENT:
The biopsy of the pleura shows a biphasic malignancy, with an epithelioid
component consisting of well-differentiated tubulopapillary structures
infiltrating the pleural stroma and chest wall, associated with a closely
opposed cytologically malignant spindle cell component with variable
collagenzation. This biphasic pattern is characteristic of malignant
mesothelioma, particularly in the setting of a predominantly left-sided
pleural-based loculated effusion with thickening.  Histochemical stains show
the neoplastic cells fail to express diastase-resistant PAS-positive mucin,
and immunostains show that the neoplastic cells express nuclear calretinin,
and WT1 with cytoplasmic cytokeratin 5/6 and D2-40. Stains for
carcinoembryonic antigen, CD15, BER-EP4, B72.3 and TTF are negative. Stains
for desmin and S100 protein stain only background reactive mesenchymal cells.

Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 **PLACE, IL)
RESULTS:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on this malignant
mesothelioma demonstrate 19 (26.8%) cells with homozygous loss and 7 (9.9%) of
cells with hemizygous loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of
chromosome 9 was 0.69. The targeted region (total 71 cells) is considered to
be POSITIVE for p16 (9p21) deletion. 
Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9:      
Normal Range Ratio:  0.85-1.19
Normal % deletion: less than 20%
Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16
deletion in malignant mesotheliomas. 
FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis
of a minimum of 60 cells.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in two parts.
Part 1 is received unfixed and is labeled with the patient' s name, initials
PM, medical record number, and "small bowel with colon".  The specimen
measures 30.0 x 24.0 x 11.5 cm and consists of an intermingled mass of bowel. 
There is a segment of right colon extending from the specimen measuring 30.0
cm in length x 5.0 to 9.0 cm in open circumference.  There is an additional
unoriented, adherent segment of bowel measuring 22.0 cm in length x 3.5 to 5.0
cm in open circumference.  The appendix is identified and measures 4.5 cm in
length x 1.1 cm in diameter.
Multiple peritoneal plaques measuring up to 8.0 x 7.0 cm are identified. 
Sectioning reveals that the plaques at least partially encase the bowel and
extend down in to the subserosal adipose tissue.  The sectioned surfaces of
the plaques are tan white and firm.  The largest plaque extends down in to the
peri-intestinal adipose tissue and approaches a 3.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm red-tan
nodule.  The appendiceal lumen measures 0.5 cm however, it narrows to a
pinpoint opening at the level of the cecum and is partially surrounded by
dense fibrotic tissue in that location.  Multiple bowel adhesions are present
with the bowel taking a very tortuous path through the specimen.
The mucosal surfaces of the bowel are tan-red and normally plicated without
gross lesions.  Multiple, possible, tan-red lymph nodes are identified in the
peri-intestinal adipose tissue.  Representative sections are submitted in 15
cassettes.
Digital photographs are taken.
Ink Code:
Red  distal mucosal margin, segment of right colon extending from specimen
Green  mucosal margins, adherent segment of bowel
Blue  mucosal margin, stapled end of small bowel  
Cassette Code:
1A  Red margin
1B  Blue margin
1C-1D  Green margins
1E-1G  Tumor in relation to bowel
1H  Tumor extending towards tan-red nodule
1I-1J  Representative tumor
1K  Proximal appendix with surrounding fibrotic tissue
1L  Appendiceal tip, bisected
1M-1N  Representative appendix
1O  5 possible lymph nodes, whole
Part 2 received unfixed with the patient's name, initials PM, labeled
"peritonectomy tissue" consists of 7 irregular portions of pink-yellow
hemorrhagic fat, fibrous tissue and skin ranging from 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm to
7.0 x 6.0 x 0.5 cm.  The largest portion of tissue is densely fibrotic with
areas of obvious tumor 0.5 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative
sections are submitted labeled 2A through 2C.

The immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7, CAM 5.2 and calretinin are
positive in the malignant cells, while pancytokeratin and WT-1 are focally
positive.  The stain for cytokeratin 20, thyroid transcription factor, CD34,
desmin, S100 protein and CEA are negative.  This staining pattern supports the
diagnosis.

COMMENT:
The diffuse malignant mesothelioma shows characteristic tubulopapillary growth
pattern, associated with extensive pleural and angiolymphatic infiltration. 
Immunostains show a typical pattern of staining for malignant mesothelioma
within neoplastic cells expressing nuclear calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6,
thrombomodulin, D2-40, and WT-1, and failing to express TTF-1, CEA, B72.3,
Leu-M1, PSA, thyroglobulin, and CDX-2.  Focal expression of BerEP4 is present.
 Histochemical stains show glycogen expression with PAS stains, but no
intracytoplasmic neutral mucin production with diastase pre-digestive PAS
stains.  Overall, this histomorphology and immunophenotype is characteristic
of a diffuse malignant mesothelioma.
Samples of the level-7 and level-5 lymph nodes show occasional cells within
the subcapsular sinus of the nodes, documented by cytokeratin stains.  For
this reason, we would stage this pleural mesothelioma as a T4N1 malignant
mesothelioma.

COMMENT:
The left lung specimens demonstrate a diffuse malignant mesothelioma,
predominantly epithelioid type showing papillary, hyaline and solid tumor
growth associated with vascular invasion and focal extensive necrosis.  The
mesothelioma is unequivocally predominantly of an epithelioid type although
very focal zones of spindle growth are identified.  
While the pleura show hyaline pleural plaques, the underlying lung parenchyma
shows tobacco induce lung injury, predominantly respiratory bronchiolitis and
emphysematous change.  No evidence of diffuse fibrosis as one would expect in
asbestosis is seen, and iron stain failed to demonstrate significant numbers
of asbestos type ferruginous bodies.

Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 **PLACE, IL)
RESULTS:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on this malignant
mesothelioma  demonstrate 58 (98.4%) cells with homozygous loss and 0 (0%) of
cells with hemizygous loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of
chromosome 9 was 0.03. The targeted region (total 60 cells) is considered to
be POSITIVE for p16 (9p21) deletion. 
Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9:      
Normal Range Ratio:  0.85-1.19
Normal % deletion: less than 20%
Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16
deletion in malignant mesotheliomas.

_______________________________________________________________
ADDENDUM
Addendum     
Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 **PLACE, IL)
RESULTS:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on the left pleural
biopsy demonstrate 0(0%) cells with homozygous loss and 0(0%) of cells with
hemizygous loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of chromosome 9 was
1.0. The targeted region (total 68 cells) is considered to be NEGATIVE for p16
(9p21) deletion. 
Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9:      
Normal Range Ratio:  0.85-1.19
Normal % deletion: less than 20%
Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16
deletion in malignant mesotheliomas.

COMMENT:
Immunoperoxidase studies performed at the outside institute demonstrate that
the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, calretinin and CA125 and
negative for cytokeratin 20, monoclonal CEA, cytokeratin 5/6, TTF1, estrogen
and progesterone receptors.  These results support the morphologic impression
that this case represents a malignant mesothelioma of epithelioid type.  A
paraffin block will be requested and  FISH studies for p16 deletion will be
performed.  The results will be reported as an addendum.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PARTS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:  PLEURA, RIGHT, MULTIPLE PLEURAL BIOPSIES 
A.          DIFFUSE MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, BIPHASIC TYPE (EPITHELIOID AND

B.     CHRONIC PLEURITIS WITH HYALINE PLEURAL PLAQUES.
SY/tf
TF/TF
COMMENT:
The pleural biopsies show multifocal nodular disease characterized by a
malignant cellular proliferation of both epithelioid cells growing primarily
in sheets and spindle cells in irregular fascicles associated with dense
collagen. The cytomorphology and infiltrative growth are characteristic of a
malignant neoplasm, with morphologic features of diffuse malignant
mesothelioma.  Histochemical and immunohistochemical stains support this
diagnosis in that the neoplastic cells are nuclear calretinin, cytokeratin
5/6, D2-40, and WT-1 positive, while stains for TTF-1, CD15, B72.3, BerEP4,
and carcinoembryonic antigen are negative.  PAS-diastase and PAS stains are
negative.  This morphology and immunophenotype, combined with the history of
right pleural effusion with pleural thickening and asbestos exposure
(supported by the presence of hyaline pleural plaques), provide significant
support for the diagnosis of diffuse malignant mesothelioma.

AMENDED/CORRECTED REPORT:
Amended date:  2/26/2009.
Reason:  Final Diagnosis edit.
The reason for amended report is that in the Final Diagnosis, Part 6 labeled
as "pleura" was initially entirely submitted to Tissue Bank for research
purposes and no tissue was submitted for diagnostic purposes.  This was
communicated to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on 02/13/2009, who requested that the tissue is
also submitted for diagnostic purposes.    
Original sign-out date:  2/12/2009.
This Amended Report supersedes all prior reports under this accession number

_______________________________________________________________
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in eight parts.
Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient name, initials GRS and
"pleura".  It consists of two irregular fragments of moderately firm
hemorrhagic, tan-yellow portions of tissue, together measuring 6.5 x 3.9 x 1.8
cm.  Surfaces are shaggy.  Cut surfaces are solid tan-white.  As requested by
the surgeon, a representative portion of this tissue is sent to Precision
Therapeutics.  Additionally received in the specimen container is a 3.8 x 3.8
x 0.8 cm portion of clotted blood.  Representative sections are submitted in
cassettes 1A through 1C.
1A-1C x 4, representative sections
Part two is received in formalin, labeled with the patient' s name, initials
GRS, and "sixth rib".  It consists of a rib bone measuring 12.3 cm. in length
and 1.5 x 0.8 cm. in cross dimensions.  Additionally received are two segments
of rib measuring 2.0 and 2.9 cm. in length each.  The surfaces are focally
charred, hemorrhagic and shaggy, although no discrete nodularity is seen
grossly.  A minimal amount of soft tissue is loosely attached.  Two
representative sections are submitted in cassette 2A.
2A x 2, bone following decalcification
Part three is received in formalin, labeled with the patient' s name, initials
GRS, and "level 11".  It consists of four irregular fragments of pink gray
rubbery probable lymphoid tissue measuring 1.9 x 1.8 x 0.5 cm. in aggregate. 
The specimen is wrapped in lens paper and totally submitted in one cassette
labeled 3A.
3A x 4, entirely submitted
Part four is received in formalin, labeled with the patient' s name, initials
GRS, and "level 10 lymph node".  It consists of a 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm.
aggregate of minimally hemorrhagic gray red rubbery tissue fragments.  The
specimen is entirely submitted in a cassette labeled 4A.
4A x multiple, entirely submitted
Part five is received in formalin, labeled with the patient' s name, initials
GRS, and "level 7 lymph node".  It consists of four irregular fragments of
gray red probable lymphoid tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm. in aggregate. 
The specimen is wrapped in lens paper and totally submitted in one cassette
labeled 5A.
5A x 4, entirely submitted
Part six is received in formalin, labeled with the patient' s name, initials
GRS, and "right lung".  It consists of a total pneumectomy specimen, measuring
33.3 x 23.5 x 7.5 cm. in greatest overall dimensions.  The pleural surface is
pink red with numerous shaggy areas and rubbery firm tan white patchy nodular
areas predominantly over the middle and lower lobes, although small nodules
are also noted on the upper lobe.  These plaque like areas measure up to 19.5
x 10.5 x 1.8 cm. attached to the lower lobe.  Because of the nodularity and
shaggy nature, the lobes are not easily distinguishable from each other. 
Additionally, exposed lung parenchyma is also noted in shaggy areas.  Lymphoid
tissue is noted at the hilum.  The upper lobe bronchial resection is also
exposed.  On opening of the vascular and bronchiolar structures, no obvious
obstructions or lesions are noted.  On sectioning through the lung parenchyma,
the tan white nodular tissue extends into the underlying parenchyma in the
area of the middle lobe.  This tan white nodular tissue comes to within 1.7
cm. of the bronchiolar and vascular margins at the hilum.  The base of the
lower lobe is covered by smooth pink tan fibromembranous tissue.  The main
parenchyma is tan red, spongy with focal black flecks. Representative sections
are submitted as follows:
6A x multiple, hilar bronchus margin and vascular margin 
6B x multiple, upper lobe exposed bronchial margin and vascular margin
6C - 6D x multiple, lymphoid tissue at hilum (6C one node sectioned)
6E x multiple, representative section upper lobe
6F x 1, representative section middle lobe (away from surface)
6G x 1, lower lobe at base
6H x 1, representative section of uninvolved tissue (upper lobe)
Part seven is received in formalin, labeled with the patient' s name, initials
GRS, and "pleural tumor".  It consists of a 19.5 x 19.5 x 10.0 cm. aggregate
of solid rubbery, minimally hemorrhagic tan rubbery tissue, similar in
appearance to the previous specimens.  A scant amount of spongy red lung
parenchyma is attached to the surface.  Representative sections are submitted
in cassettes 7A and 7B.
7A - 7B x 1 each, representative sections
Part eight is received in formalin, labeled with the patient' s name, initials
GRS, and "foreign body".  It consists of 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. circular fragment
of tan brown stone like material.  No soft tissue is received with this
fragment and no sections are submitted.  This specimen is for gross
examination only.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in six parts, each in a properly labeled container. 
Part 1 is received in formalin labeled with the patient name, initials JLB and
"mesenteric nodule".  It consists of a focally charred pale pink-yellow soft
tissue fragment, 0.5 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm.  Lymphoid tissue is palpated.  Tissue is
entirely submitted in a cassette labeled 1A.
1A x 1, entirely submitted
Part 2 is received in formalin labeled with the patient name, initials JLB and
"extensive ileocolectomy and partial hemicolectomy".  It consists of 81.0 cm
of tortuous segment of small bowel with extensive self adhesions and almost
encompassing a mass, the mass is 7.0 x 6.3 x 5.0 cm by external dimensions.  A
raw, shaved edge of the mass is exposed to the external surface, this shaved
surface of the mass is 6.3 x 4.3 cm.  The mass is attached near one end of the
small bowel segment, 5.0 cm from a previous line of anastomosis; the
anastomosis to 10.0 cm of large bowel (distal margin).  At the opposite end
(proximal margin), is a second line of anastomosis noted 2.0 cm from the
margin.  The lines of anastomosis are well-healed and unremarkable, the one
nearest the mass is 8.5 cm in circumference and the one furthest from the mass
is 6.0 cm in circumference.  There are no mucosal lesions or nodules, however
the significant adhesions cause focal stricture.  At the level of the
submucosal mass, the mucosa is without folding, is focally congested and
indurated.  Adjacent to the mass and opposite the attachment of small bowel is
an area of interest indicated by the surgeon, designated duodenum.  This
margin is shaved and it is 1.5 x 1.3 cm in cross diameters and lies 1.5 cm
from the mass.  The lumen is only probe-patent and ends blindly within the
mass; extending 3.0 cm in length.  Cut sections of the mass (5.4 x 5.2 x 4.0
cm) are solid pink-white and with central green-gray softening.  The mass lies
75.0 cm from the proximal resected margin and 15.0 cm from the nearest
resected margin.  A normal amount of mesenteric tissues are present and a
minimal amount of fatty tissues are attached.  Prominent, normal appearing
vasculature is noted about the mass.  There is no bowel wall thickening and
the average circumference of the small bowel is 6.5 cm and that of the large
bowel is 12.0 cm.  Numerous glistening, pink lymph nodes are identified within
the fatty tissues.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:
2A x 2, shave of duodenum marked by surgeon and adjacent shave of vessels
2B x 2, resected margin furthest from mass (proximal)
2C x 1, anastomosis 2.0 cm from this resected margin (2B)
2D x 1, opposite resected margin, large bowel, nearest the mass
2E x 1, anastomosis nearest the mass, large bowel to small bowel
2F x 2, shave of vessels, margin, adjacent to mass 
2G-2H x 1 each, mass and mucosa
2I-2J x 1 each, mass and radial margin opposite exposed shaved margin 
2K x 2, one bisected lymph node
2L-2M x 3 each, one bisected lymph node, fragmented
2N x 2, one bisected lymph node

2T x 4, two bisected lymph nodes, one inked 
2U x 2, two lymph nodes intact 
2V x 2, two lymph nodes intact 
2W x 3, three lymph nodes intact .
Part three is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the
patient' s name, initials JLB, and "ureter margin".  It consists of a 0.5 x
0.4 x 0.3 cm. irregular fragment of pink tan rubbery tissue.  A lumen is not
visualized grossly.  The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section and
resubmitted for permanent section in cassette labeled 3AFS.
3AFS x 1, frozen section, entirely submitted  
Part 4 is received in formalin labeled with the patient name, initials JLB and
"liver tumor".  It consists of two irregular focally charred, congested
shaggy, rubbery tissue fragments, 4.6 x 2.8 x 2.0 cm and 3.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. 
Greater than 50% of the tissues are composed of pink-white solid tissue. 
Normal red-brown liver parenchyma is minimal.  The firm pink-white tissue is
at resected margin.  Representative sections are submitted in three cassettes
labeled 4A-4C.
4A-4C x 4 pieces total, soft tissue 
Part 5 is received in formalin labeled with the patient name, initials JLB and
"partial gastrectomy".  It consists of a wedge of pink-tan serosal covered
tissue, 6.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm.  The resected margin staple line is 7.6 cm in
length.  The serosal aspect is unremarkable.  The staple line is excised and
the adjacent tissues are inked.  Cut sections show no nodules or areas of
induration.  Folding pattern is normal.  Representative sections are submitted
in two cassettes labeled 5A-5B.
5A-5B x 2 each, soft tissue 
Part 6 is received in formalin labeled with the patient name, initials JLB and
"mesofold lymph node".  It consists of pale yellow rubbery tissue, 0.2 x 0.2 x
0.2 cm.  Lymphoid tissue is palpated.  Tissue is entirely submitted in a
cassette labeled 6A.

ADDENDA:
Addendum     
Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 **PLACE, IL)
RESULTS:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on the pleural biopsy 
demonstrate 60 (96.8%) cells with homozygous loss and 0 (0%) of cells with
hemizygous loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of chromosome 9 was
0.04. The targeted region (total 62 cells) is considered to be POSITIVE for
p16 (9p21) deletion. 
Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9:      
Normal Range Ratio:  0.85-1.19
Normal % deletion: less than 20%
Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16
deletion in malignant mesotheliomas. 
FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis
of a minimum of 60 cells.

NCS/NCS
COMMENT:
Part 1:  The pleura is markedly thickened and exhibits hyaline pleural
plaques.  In addition there is an atypical cellular infiltrate which
infiltrates the thickened pleura and adipose tissue.  Focal tubulopapillary
configuration and myxoid change is also appreciated.  The malignant cells are
immunoreactive for pancytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, EMA,
cytokeratin 5/6, Calretinin, WT-1 and HBME-1.  No positivity is observed with
CD15 and CEA, both of which exhibit background staining.  The PAS-D stain does
not exhibit positivity within the vacuolated cells.  
The morphologic appearance in conjunction with the immunohistochemical
staining pattern and the radiographic/operative findings, supports the
diagnosis of an epithelioid malignant mesothelioma.

_______________________________________________________________
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Specimen is received unfixed in ten parts.
Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "sixth rib". 
Received are two firm tan-red rib segments with a scant amount of attached
tan-pink soft tissue measuring 10.5 and 13.0 cm in length respectively and
each 1.5 cm in diameter.  The cut surface is yellow-red and trabecular.  No
gross lesions are identified.  A representative cross-section of each is
submitted following routine decalcification in cassette labeled 1A.
Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "old thoracotomy
scar".  Received is an 11.5 x 0.5 cm elongated ellipse of soft, tan-white skin
with 2.0 cm of underlying tan-yellow fibroadipose tissue.  The skin surface
exhibits a well-healed slightly raised scar that runs the length of the long
axis.  No gross skin lesions or suspicious nodules are identified within the
fibroadipose tissue.  Representative full thickness cross-sections are
submitted in cassette 2A.
Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "pleura".  Received
are five unoriented firm, pink to tan-gray fibromembranous appearing tissue
fragments ranging from 3.0 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm to 9.3 x 4.7 x 1.2 cm and 9.3 x 7.0
x 1.2 cm in aggregate.  The external surface is finely granular to roughened
and focally cauterized.  On cross section the cut surface is smooth, densely
firm and pink-white. Representative cross sections of each are submitted in
cassettes labeled 3A thru 3C.
Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "plaque near
descending aorta".  Received is a portion of tan-gray soft tissue measuring
1.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.  The tissue is entirely submitted following intraoperative
frozen section consultation labeled 4AFS.
Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "retroaortic
tissue".  Received are two focally roughened, yellow-gray soft tissue
fragments measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm and 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm respectively. 
After intraoperative frozen section consultation the tissue is submitted
labeled 5AFS.
Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "paraesophageal
tissue".  Received is an ovoid, portion of tan-gray soft tissue measuring 0.4
x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.  The tissue is submitted labeled 6A.
Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "subcarinal lymph
node".  Received is a soft gray and anthracotic lymph node measuring 1.0 x 0.6
x 0.4 cm.  Separately received is a portion of yellow-red soft tissue
measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm.  The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette
labeled 7A.

Part 8 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "left lung".  The
specimen is received fresh and consists of an extrapleural pneumonectomy
specimen (21.0 x 17.0 x 5.3 cm, 821 grams) with a 3.0 cm in length segment of
patent bronchial remnant (1.5 cm in diameter) and patent segment of pulmonary
artery (2.5 cm in diameter).  
The external surface of the specimen is largely covered by irregular, shaggy,
firm, fibrous tissue with rib fossilization.  There is an 8.5 x 8.0 cm portion
of smooth, glistening, gray-tan, membranous tissue located at the
anterior/medial/inferior aspect which appears to represent pericardium. There
is a 9.0 x 7.0 cm area of exposed tan-red lung parenchyma at the
posterior/medial/inferior aspect.  The lung is essentially encased by a
tan-white, firm, fibrous tumor that measures up to 3.0 cm in thickness,
surrounds the majority of the lung and is adherent to the diaphragm.  The
tumor partially surrounds bronchial tributaries and pulmonary vessels at the
hilum, involves adipose tissue, and extends down and obliterates the oblique
fissure.  The tumor grossly extends into the lung parenchyma and to the
external edge of the specimen. 
The intimal surface of the pulmonary artery has a small amount of yellow
streaking.  The remaining lung parenchyma is tan-red without additional gross
mass lesions. Multiple, possible anthracotic lymph nodes are identified at the
hilum. 
Representative tumor tissue is procured for the clinical tissue bank.
Digital images are taken.

Part 9 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "level 10 lymph
node".  Received is a portion of soft, yellow-red adipose tissue measuring 2.0
x 1.0 x 0.6 cm.  One ovoid, smooth, soft, pink and anthracotic lymph node is
identified within the tissue measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension.  The
entire specimen is submitted in cassette labeled 9A.
Part 10 is labeled with the patient's name, initials JH and "pleura along
diaphragm".  Received is a portion of pleura with attached diaphragm 18.5 x
12.5 x 6.0 cm in overall dimensions.  The pleura is densely firm and thickened
with a red and hemorrhagic, smooth anterior surface demonstrating rib
fossilization, measuring 18.5 x 12.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest thickness.  On
cross-section the cut surface has a diffuse smooth and grey-white appearance
and extends to the edges.
The diaphragm is pink-red, densely firm and thickened up to 1.8 cm. On
cross-section, the diaphragm has a similar smooth and gray-white cut surface
that also extends to the edges.  There is soft red-brown muscle attached to
the inferior aspect.
Digital images are taken.  Representative tissue from the pleura and diaphragm
are procured for clinical tissue bank.

MICROSCOPIC:
Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.  An
immunohistochemical stain for calretinin performed on 2A is negative. VVG
stain performed on multiple sections (8D, 8H, 8K, AND 10K) highlights the
elastic layer of pleura and confirms that malignant mesothelioma is invading
the lung parenchyma.  Immunohistochemical stains for calretinin and AE1/3
performed on 4 AFS confirm the presence of malignant mesothelioma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received unfixed in four parts.
Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials TM and "falciform
ligament".  The specimen consists of a tan-gray, soft portion of fibroadipose
tissue measuring 6.5 x 5.0 x 1.0 cm.  There is a 5-cm in length portion of
possible ligament present with a diameter of 0.6 cm. Representative
cross-sections of the potential ligament and adjacent fibromembranous tissue
are submitted in cassettes labeled 1A and 1B.  
Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials TM and "spleen and
omentum".  The specimen consists of a pink-gray, soft to firm spleen measuring
12.0 x 7.5 x 5.5 cm.  Spleen pleural surface has a circular appearance with
extensive yellow-gray fibrous adhesions.  The spleen has a formalin fixed
weight of 250 g.  The gray fibrous lesion does not grossly extend into the
splenic parenchyma.  The lesions are adherent to the capsular surface.  There
is also an adherent portion of omentum measuring 36.0 x 7.0 x 1.5 cm.  There
are numerous tan-gray, firm nodules present in the omentum ranging in size
from 0.4 cm in greatest dimension to 15.0 x 6.0 x 1.0 cm.  Digital images are
taken and representative cross-sections are submitted in the following
cassettes:
2A, 2B - lesions, capsule and splenic parenchyma at hilus
2C, 2D - lesions, capsule and splenic parenchyma
2E-2J - representative cross-sections of the fibrous lesions in the omentum
Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials TM and "appendix".  The
specimen consists of a hemorrhagic and roughened appendix measuring 4.0 x 1.0
x 1.0 cm.  There is adherent gray fibrous, roughened and hemorrhagic tissue
present. The resection margin is inked blue and removed.  The tip is fibrous
and focally hemorrhagic.  The wall is thickened and fibrous and ranges from
0.1 to 0.3 cm.  The lumen diameter ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. the appendix is
entirely submitted and representative cross sections of the remaining adherent
soft tissue are submitted in the following cassettes:
3A - bisected tip and inked resection margin
3B-3C - the remainder of the appendix is submitted from tip to resection
margin
3D - representative cross sections of the remaining soft tissue
Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials TM and "peri tumor". The
specimen consists of multiple tan-gray, soft to firm fragments of tissue
ranging in size from 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm to 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm.  There are
multiple gray fibrous nodules present.  The specimens are serially cross
sectioned revealing gray fibrous tissue.  Representative cross-sections are
submitted in cassettes labeled 4A, 4B and 4C.
